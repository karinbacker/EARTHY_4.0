The files in this folder are linked to each other. 
Please leave the structure of the folders as is after copying the folder. 


The references in the Python notebook are set up with this folder as the root directory, 
but the file paths in the GH script have to be manually updated after copying. 

There are three file paths, two in the urban analysis script: 
1. OSM data for the urban analysis; 
2. Excel data file to write the result of the urban analysis to; 

and one in the cube model script: 
3. Excel configuration output file 


Also, I painstakingly converted all variables from globals to dictionary items in the notebook. 
I tested the game a number of times and it should be fully resolved but please contact me if I missed one or two!
